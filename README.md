# retrolaunch

A little shell script to launch ROMs using RetroArch on macOS. I wrote this script so that I can test ROMs prior to importing to a playlist in RetroArch.

Additionally, I included the Automator App (a droplet) and Quick Action workflow.

## Requirements

[RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) (obviously)

A Mac, if you want to use the Automator App and Quick Action Workflow.

## Install

Make the script executable using `sudo chmod 755 /path/to/retrolaunch.sh` and put it anywhere you want.

## Usage

```bash
% /path/to/retrolaunch.sh /path/to/your.rom
```

## To do

- Include more cores and suffixes
- â€¦
